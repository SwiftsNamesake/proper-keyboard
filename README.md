# Proper Keyboard
This Elm package introduces proper type safe keys, to save you - humble developer - from having to look up
or (God forbid) _memorise_ JavaScript keycodes.

Since this is an open source project, contributions and feedback are welcome.

# Usage

# TODO
- [ ] Complete the documentation
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Key descriptions (although how do we deal with international layouts)
- [ ] Full coverage (all keys must be representable)
- [ ] Key categories (Numeric, operator, punctuation, letter), possibly intersecting
- [ ] Physical layout descriptions
